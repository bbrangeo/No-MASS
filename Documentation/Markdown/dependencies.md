# Dependencies Of NoMASS                    {#dependencies}

No-MASS depends on two external libraies, Google Tests and RapidXML. Google test is only needed to run the No-MASS tests.

These should be downloaded automatically with the command:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

However if this fails then they can be manually downloaded.

* [Google Tests](https://github.com/google/googletest)
* [RapidXML](https://github.com/dwd/rapidxml)
